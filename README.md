# Making NPM Packages of React Components

A presentation made with [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) for an upcoming MPR tech talk. We're rather new to making NPM packages as an organization, and I wanted to share what I've learned.

## Running this presentation

See the *package.json* form possible commands. To publish, run `npm run build` then `npm run stylefix` to actually link up the custom theme properly. For more flags and options, look at [reveal-md's]([reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md)) and [reveal.js's](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) documentation (see below).
